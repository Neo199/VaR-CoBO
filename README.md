# VaR-CoBO
Repository for the simulations and methods run in the Scalable Variational Bayesian Optimisation for Combinatorial Problems paper by Seth and Fop 

## Installations
Please install the github version of the sparsevb R package here. A few changes were made to accomodate the package into our method.
Stan is required to run all the comparison approaches.
All the other packages can be installed from CRAN.

## Usage
The user can use directly the test examples if they want. The minimisation and maximisation code function variants have been separated into two separate folders for ease of use.

The main contribution function exists in the prbocs-vb.R file.
